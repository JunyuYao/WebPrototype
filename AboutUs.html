      About Save the Children 
      </h1>
      <h2>
        Here in Australia and around the world, the organisation give a powerful voice to children and champion their rights. As a global organisation, in 2019 Save the Children directly reached 38.7 million of the world’s most vulnerable children in 117 countries.

      Our Program
      </h1>
      <h2>
        <span style="color:red;">Education:</span> Save the Children is working in refugee camps on the Thai-Myanmar border to make education for refugee children count. We are working across nine camps to improve the quality of education for children. We are also working to ensure the education and professional development received by refugee teachers is recognised in Myanmar in Thailand as communities return home.
      </h2>
      <h2>
        <span style="color:red;">Health Care:</span> Access to basic healthcare can mean the difference between life and death for children and mothers in Laos, where survival is compromised by unsafe birthing practices, chronic malnutrition, low rates of immunisation and a lack of well-trained health workers. We’re providing remote health centres with essential medical equipment. We’re encouraging better nutrition and care practices within families. And we’re supporting health workers and midwives through training and mentoring.
      </h2>
      <h2>
        <span style="color:red;">End Violence:</span> Violence against children can take many forms ­– including family violence, child trafficking and exploitation. We’re building supportive community environments that respond when children are at risk. We’re strengthening community-based child protection systems. And we’re bringing about long-term policy change that helps keep girls and boys safe from all forms of violence.

    <h1>Source of Our Funds</h1>
    <img src="Content/Funds.png" alt="Funds"style="width:1000px;height:600px;">
    </div>
    <h2>
      Our main source of funding is donations from supporters of our organization around the world. We can see that in 2019 more than 80% of the income will come from donations, and the remaining 20% will come from government departments and other investments. Without these donations, the organization would not have been able to operate, let alone carry out programs to help children around the world.
